All systems:

Check that MOPAC will run the job Example_data_set.mop.  This job should take about 0.05 seconds to run.  After the job runs successfully, as a safety precaution, change permissions on the MOPAC folder to prevent writing to it.  This is a security step intended to stop any accidental or deliberate attempts to mess with the contents of the MOPAC folder.

To run MOPAC jobs:

4.1.  Right-click on a MOPAC data-set. Click on "Open with" In Windows-7, chose MOPAC2016.  In Windows-10, click on "Choose another app", then click on MOPAC2016

There are many other ways to run MOPAC, but these two, "drag and drop" on the icon, and "Open with" are the simplest.  Other ways to run MOPAC include:

5.1.  Write a <file>.cmd to run MOPAC as a batch queue.

5.2.  From the Command Prompt.

5.3.  Have "Always use this app to open .mop files", then double-clicking on a MOPAC data-set would run it immediately. Single-click would allow you to choose an editor, e.g. notepad.




You are now ready to run MOPAC2016.  If you are new to mopac, please see:
